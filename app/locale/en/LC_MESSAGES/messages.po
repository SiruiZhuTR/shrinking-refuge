msgid "Refugee cap"
msgstr ""

msgid "The number of refugees admitted to the United States each fiscal year cannot exceed the ceiling set by the President, but there is no obligation to meet that level. For fiscal year 2017, Trump issued an executive order cutting the number of refugees admitted to the United States to 50,000, less than half the 110,000 former President Barack Obama had authorized. For fiscal year 2020, Trump has proposed a cap of 18,000, a 40% cut from the previous year and the lowest since the Refugee Act was signed into law in 1980. "

msgstr ""

msgid "Soon after taking office Trump issued an order banning most travel from a handful of several Muslim-majority countries. The ban was later modified and applied to Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia as well as North Korea and some government officials in Venezuela. The ban, which the U.S. Supreme Court allowed to take effect following legal challenges, has been in place since in Dec. 2017. While refugees are exempt from the ban, many refugees from the countries subject to the ban face additional security vetting. Before the ban was implemented, in FY2017, 28% of refugees arrivals were from the countries subject to travel restrictions compared to 3% in FY2019. "
